Tektronix TDS210/TDS220 RS232 waveform acquisation example. 

Based on the resources from TekWiki https://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/TDS210 (especially the example RS232 programs https://w140.com/tekwiki/images/c/c5/066-0108-00.zip ).

** volt/time scaling is untested (not needed for my purposes). You can probably figure them out from the official Tektronix RS232 API documentations, like https://download.tek.com/manual/071038103web.pdf , if they don't work. **
